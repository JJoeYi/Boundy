# Boundy
An interactive gamified Python application for editing and annotating polygons on images. This project combines image processing, contour detection, polygon approximation, and real-time user interaction to allow users to edit and annotate polygons on images. It's a useful tool for tasks such as object annotation, image segmentation, and more.

## Key Features

- Image preprocessing, edge detection, and contour detection.
- Polygon approximation for contour annotation.
- Interactive polygon editing:
  - Add points by left-clicking.
  - Remove nearby points by right-clicking.
  - Continuous point removal while holding right-click.
- Sorting of polygon points in clockwise order.
- Real-time display of edited polygons on the image.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV 

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries (OpenCV, Numpy).
3. Run the Python script with your image file path.
